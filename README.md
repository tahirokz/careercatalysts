This is Computational intelligence mini project on llm based application
Explanation of the Provided Files:

File 1: main.py
This file sets up a REST API using FastAPI. Here's what it does:
Imports Libraries: Handles file uploads, environment variables, and HTTP exceptions.
Loads Environment Variables: Sets up the OpenAI API key from the .env file.
Defines a Validation Function: Ensures the job description includes key elements like responsibilities, skills, etc.
Defines the /analyze/ Endpoint:
Takes a resume (PDF file) and job description (string) as inputs.
Validates the job description and extracts text from the PDF using extract_text_from_pdf.
Ensures the resume has enough content (at least 50 words).
Compares the resume and job description using the compare_resume function.
Returns the analysis as a JSON response.
Runs the Server: Launches the API on port 8000 using uvicorn.


File 2: resume_logic.py
This file contains the logic for analyzing resumes:
Imports Libraries: Uses LangChain and OpenAI for LLM capabilities.
Defines compare_resume Function:
Initializes a GPT-4 instance using the OpenAI API key.
Sets up a prompt template that guides the LLM to compare resumes and job descriptions.
The AI evaluates compatibility, strengths, and weaknesses, then returns a structured response.


File 3: pdf_processor.py
This file processes PDF files:
Imports PyPDF2: A library for reading PDF files.
Defines extract_text_from_pdf Function:
Extracts text from all pages of a given PDF file.
Concatenates the extracted text into a single string for further analysis.


File 4: gradio_app.py
This file sets up a user-friendly interface using Gradio:
Imports Libraries: Uses requests for API communication and gradio for the UI.
Defines analyze Function:
Validates that both a resume file and a job description are provided.
Sends a POST request to the FastAPI endpoint (/analyze/) with the resume and job description.
Handles errors and displays the analysis results.
Builds the Gradio Interface:
Creates a user-friendly UI with a file uploader for resumes and a text box for job descriptions.
Includes custom CSS for styling.
